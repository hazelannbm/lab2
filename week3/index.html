<h1>Hazel Ann Mones - WEBPROG SS221</h1>

<h2>Pronouns</h2>
<p>she/he/they</p>

<h2>I.T. Experience: Programming / Gaming / Others</h2>
<p>I wouldn’t say I’m an excellent back-end developer, but I do have experience in HTML, CSS (we learned  it  back  in  Grade  9  and  it  was  briefly  discussed  in  our  USERDES  last  term),  Java,  and Python. For gaming, I’m really interested in video games, and I play quite a lot. I play FPS games, action-adventure games, and many more, mostly with my friends. This actually made me consider entering the gaming industry, as well.</p>

<h2>Hobbies / Interests</h2>
<p>I like reading books, novels, comics, etc. My current favorite book right now is called “Wonder” by RJ Palacio, and it has been my favorite book for years now. No book has yet surpassed it. I also like singing and just performing, in general. I’m currentlya vocalist of APC Band. With that, I guess you can assume that I love music, as well. I have written songs a few years ago but I fell 
into a slump and am still finding my way back to writing again. I’m a big dog and cat lover but my parents wouldn’t let me have a pet because we sell different kinds of dishes. As I’ve mentioned above, I like playing video games with my friends, it’s stressful most of the time but I guess I just love to suffer. I’m a big marvel fan, not the surface-level kind. I’m really into the universe and I have been into it for years now. My favorite marvel movie is Guardians of the Galaxy, the first one, and my favorite marvel series is Moon Knight.</p>

<h2>Do you have a dream that you wish to fulfill? If yes, what is your dream?</h2>
<p>I don’t really have a specific dream like “be a millionaire at the age of 25,” “build a house,” “have pets,” etc. I think the biggest dream that I wish to fulfill right now is to just be accepted by parents. Being  a  queer  person  in  an  extremely  Christian  family  is...  hard.  I  know  that  my  parents’ upbringing, of course, has affected the way they see things and I’ve come to accept that that will always be the case.But I just want them to seethat it’s still... me.</p>

<h2>Any other interesting aspects of your life that you would like to share.</h2>
<p>I’m not a very interesting person so I don’t really knowwhat to add to this section. All my life, all I’ve known is studying(most  would  say  is  quite  boring,  which  is  quite  true,  I  guess).  I  was  a consistent top 1 in my elementary days,but life was quite hard during my last year in elementary,soI only graduated as a salutatorian—which, I am grateful for! It’s still a great achievement, I’m sure most would agree, but I couldn’t help but feel disappointed with myself. I couldn’t even say that “I did my best” because I know that I didn’t and maybe, just maybe, if I had done my best, then I would have graduated as a valedictorian, just like my parents wanted. But they never blamed me, no.They were always supportive. I continued my studies ata Science High School,and they didn’t lie when they said that attending a Science High School will ruin one’s life (an exaggeration, of course, but you get what I mean).My 6 years as a Scientian(what we call students in Taguig Science High School) werefruitful, one of the best years of my life;I met friends that I still talk to up  to this  day.  High  school  was tough,but  I  learned  so  much  from  it.  Now,  a  college  student, studying is still the most important thing to me. Unlike some students, the rich ones—who have a safety net and can afford to fail, I don’t have that. I don’t have that luxury. This is my last chance, and  as pessimisticas it sounds, it’s true. I mess this up, it’s over. I have a scholarship that I’m protecting, SM  scholarship,  which  allows  me  to  not  worry  about  my  tuition  fee  anymore.  SM Foundation pays 100% of my tuition fee and so I am forever grateful for that.Which means that I also don’t have any time to joke around.

I don’t know how that went from me thinking of something interesting about my life to actually narrating my whole life story,but I hope that was interesting enough...</p>
